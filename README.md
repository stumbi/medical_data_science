The project contains three separate models, that we bilt and compared to each other. We tried three different approaches found in several papers. In the folders Model1, Model2, Model3 the different models can be found. They are in the same order as in the assignment paper. In the code folder, the code to upsample the data can be found. In data the data itself is stored.
